      </p>
      <h4>3.1 Personal Data You Provide to Us.</h4>
      <p>
        We collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name,
        e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, and password
        (identifiers and professional or employment-related information) when
        you download and install the Products, create an account to log in to
        our network, or sign-up for our newsletter or other marketing material
        (internet/electronic activity). When you order Products on our website,
        we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction,
        including your name, email, contact information and email information.
        We also retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages
        that you store using your account (Internet electronic activity). If you
        provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail or submit a response to an
        employment opportunity posted on our website, we will collect your name
        and e-mail address (identifiers), as well as any other content included
        in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that
        you submit to us, such as a resume (professional or employment related
        information). When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect
        additional profile information. When you post messages on the message
        boards of our website, the information contained in your posting will be
        stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it
        (Internet/electronic activity). We also collect other types of Personal
        Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as operating system and
        version, Product version numbers, and other requested information if you
        contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Products (commercial
        information or Internet/electronic activity). We may also collect
        Personal Data, such as demographic information, from you via the
        Products or at other points in our website that state that Personal Data
        is being collected.
      </p>
      <h4>3.2 Personal Data Collected Via Technology.</h4>
      <p>
        To make our website and Products more useful to you, our servers (which
        may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Personal Data
        from you, including browser type, operating system, IP address (a number
        that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the
        Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a
        date/time stamp for your visit (identifiers, commercial information or
        Internet/electronic activity).
      </p>
      <h4>3.3 Personal Data Collected Via Cookies.</h4>
      <p>
        We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like
        Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date
        and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you
        searched and which you viewed (Internet/electronic activity). Like most
        technology companies, we automatically gather this Personal Data and
        store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your
        account on our network. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a
        website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web
        site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your
        web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until
        you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive
        experience on our website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by
        following Internet browser help file directions. You may choose to
        refuse or disable Cookies via the settings on your browser, however by
        doing so, some areas of our website may not work properly.

      <h4>3.4 Personal and/or Anonymous Data Collected By Third Parties.</h4>
      <p>
        (a) We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from other
        sources, including companies that provide our Products by way of a
        co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their
        products and/or services on our website ("Third Party Companies"). Those
        Third Party Companies may supply us with Personal Data, such as your
        calendars and address book information, in order to help us establish
        the account. We may add this information to the information we have
        already collected from you via our website in order to improve the
        Products we provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your
        convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website
        or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will
        leave our site and go to another site. During this process, another
        entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible
        for, outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms
        of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or
        content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such
        outside websites. You may determine whether or not we are responsible
        for the content of a website by reviewing the URL and confirming the
        ownership of the applicable domain by means of a service such as
        DNSstuff.com.
      </p>
      <h4>3.5 Personal Data That We Collect From You About Others.</h4>
      <p>
        If you decide to create an account for and invite a third party to join
        our network, we will collect your and the third party's names and e-mail
        addresses (identifiers) in order to send an e-mail and follow up with
        the third party. You or the third party may contact us at
        {{ email }} to request the removal of this information from our
        database.

        We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding
        information (such as your name and IP address) that makes the data
        personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze
        request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our

        contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Data in such
        communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Disclosure Of Your Personal Data.</h3>
      <h4>5.1 Disclosure to Affiliates.</h4>
      <p>
        We may share some or all of your Personal Data with other companies
        under our common control ("Affiliates"), in which case we will require
        our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires
        us or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected
        by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your
        Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also disclose
        your Personal Data to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any
        business or assets, in which case we may disclose your Personal Data to
        the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
      </p>
      <h4>5.2 Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers.</h4>
      <p>
        {{ appName }} does not and will not sell your Personal Data. Except as
        otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally share the Personal
        Data that we collect with other entities. However, we may share your
        Personal Data -- including each category of Personal Data described
        above -- with third party service providers to: (a) provide you with the
        Products that we offer you through our website; (b) process payments;
        (c) conduct quality assurance testing; (d) facilitate creation and
        maintenance of accounts; (e) collect and analyze data; (f) provide
        technical support; or (g) provide specific business services, such as
        synchronization with other software applications and marketing services.

        not to retain, use, or disclose your Personal Data other than to provide
        the services requested by us.
      </p>
      <h4>5.3 Disclosure to Other Third Party Companies.</h4>
      <p>
        We will not disclose your Personal Data to other Third Party Companies
        unless you have "opted-in" by following the instructions we provide to
        allow such disclosure, such as by registering for an event where we have
        notified you that we share attendee information with third-party
        sponsors of the event. If you have opted-in to receive e-mail
        communications from a Third Party Company and later wish to discontinue
        receipt of these e-mails, please contact the Third Party Company
        directly to update your preferences. The privacy policies of our Third
        Party Companies may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal
        Data that we collect and disclose to such Third Party Companies. Because
        we do not control the privacy practices of our Third Party Companies,
        you should read and understand their privacy policies.

        faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws
        or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) protect or
        defend our rights or property or the rights or property of users of the
        Products; or (c) protect against fraud and reduce credit risk.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Your Legal Rights regarding your Personal Data.</h3>
      <p>
        Under certain circumstances, you may have rights under applicable data
        protection laws in relation to your Personal Data.
      </p>
      <p>Where applicable, you may have the right to:</p>
      <p>
        Request information about how we collect, process, use and share your
        Personal Data (commonly known as a “right to know request”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject
        access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal
        Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This
        enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
        corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
        provide to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Request erasure of your Personal Data (commonly known as a “request to
        be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal
        Data. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
        Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object
        to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
        unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to
        comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to
        comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons
        which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your
        request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a
        legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
        processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
        rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are
        processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some
        cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
        process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Request restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables
        you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the
        following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s
        accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want
        us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no
        longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
        claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to
        verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party.
        We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal
        Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
        this right only applies to automated information which you initially
        provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
        perform a contract with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process
        your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
        processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw
        your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services
        to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
        your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to exercise any of the above rights please contact
        {{ email }}. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data
        (or to exercise any of the other rights), and MongoDB does not
        discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choice and
        rights. We will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny our Products
        to you, charge you different rates, provide a different level or quality
        of Products to you, or suggest that you may receive such different
        treatment. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is
        clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
        circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to
        help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your
        Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed
        to any person who has no right to receive it. As part of the
        verification process, we match the information submitted as part of your
        request against information stored by {{ appName }}. In some instances,
        we will require additional information in order to verify your request.
        If an authorized third party makes a data subject request on your
        behalf, we will require sufficient written proof that you have
        designated them as your authorized agent. We try to respond to all
        legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
        than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a
        number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you
        updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection
        authority if you consider that the processing of your personal
        information infringes applicable law. If you have any questions,
        concerns or complaints regarding our compliance with this notice and
        applicable data protection laws, we encourage you to first contact us.
        We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes and
        will make every reasonable effort to honour your wish to exercise your
        rights as quickly as possible and in any event, within the timescales
        provided by data protection laws.
      </p>
      <h3>7. Security Of Your Personal Data.</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
        completely secure. Although we are committed to protecting your Personal
        Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted
        to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received
        your information, we use a variety of industry-standard security
        technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from
        unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also require you to enter a
        password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your
        account password to unauthorized people. We have put in place procedures
        to deal with any suspected Personal data breach and will notify you and
        any applicable regulator of a breach where required to do so.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Data Retention.</h3>
      <p>
        We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
        satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To
        determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we
        consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the
        potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
        Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and
        whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
        applicable legal requirements.
      </p>
